### What i did today :star::stopwatch:
(29/12/2018)

* 📃 Started small, Just started implementing the paper <b>arxiv.org:1511.06309</b> titled
<b>Spato-temporal video autoencoder with differentiable memory</b>
I wrote a brief Overview of the paper defining the architecture and training process.
I'll be writing a detailed blog about the insights about the model.
That being said, i also started implementing the code for the model architecture defined in the paper.
It's almost complete.
Check out the code and the brief of the paper on my <a href='https://github.com/abtExp/ArxivImpl/tree/master/1511.06309'>github</a>


* 👨🏻‍💻 I Also discussed on the design issues of the Project-Vision, with my teammate.

* 🙇🏻‍♂️ Planned to finish the quora insincere competetion kernel on kaggle in the kaggle section, work on the controll calibration of Project-Vision in the projects section and implement my first model in pytorch in the learning part.
