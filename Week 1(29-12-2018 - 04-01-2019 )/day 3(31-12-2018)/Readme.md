### What i did today :star::stopwatch:
(31/12/2018)

* 📃 Started by reading the torch implementation of spatiotemporal video autoencoder with differentiable memory by the authors of the paper.
tried to implement the grid generator and sampler in python
* ⚔️ did some tweaking on the quora kaggle competetion kernel and finished the kernel and submitted my entry to the competition achieving an f1 score of 0.66,(top 63%)(very poor) next goal is to try different encodings and tweaking architectures to achieve more accuracy.
* ⚔️ started working on a new kernel for humpback whales classification. ran into memory issues.
* 📚 will try to complete the course material for pytorch scholarship challenge on Udacity.
* ✍️ will work on the draft of probabilistic inference of ML models.
* 🙇🏻‍♂️
will make plans for tomorrow's tasks.
